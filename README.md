# ðŸŽ™ Fake Voice Detection with LightCNN (PyTorch)

This project was developed as part of the **Summer Research Practice at HSE University**.  
It implements and trains a **LightCNN**-based model to detect **synthetic (spoofed) speech** using the **ASVSpoof 2019** dataset.  

The system is trained to distinguish between genuine and fake audio samples and achieves an **Equal Error Rate (EER)** of approximately **4%**.
